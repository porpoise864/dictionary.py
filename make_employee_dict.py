# Description: Write a class named Employee that has data members for an employee's name, ID_number, salary, and
# email_address (you must use those names - don't make them private). Write a function named make_employee_dict that
# takes as parameters a list of names, a list of ID numbers, a list of salaries and a list of email addresses. The
# function should take the first value of each list and use them to create an Employee object. It should do the same
# with the second value of each list, etc. to the end of the lists. As it creates these objects, it should add them to a
# dictionary, where the key is the ID number and the value for that key is the whole Employee object. The function
# should return the resulting dictionary.
class Person:
        make_employee_dict = {1:name[], 2: ID[], 3: salary[], 4: email[]}
        for key in make_employee_dict.items():
            key = 1,2,3,4
            return key
